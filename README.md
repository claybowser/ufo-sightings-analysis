**Description**

This UFO data analysis notebook explores a dataset of UFO sightings through data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization. It reveals trends in sighting durations and shapes, ultimately implementing a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether sightings occurred at night. The findings suggest that most UFO sightings happen at night, which may indicate that these phenomena are avoiding detection or that it's easier to misidentify satellites or aircraft under low visibility conditions.
